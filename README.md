# YouTube Video Language Translation and Lip-Sync Automation

## Project Overview
This project creates an automated pipeline for translating YouTube videos from Hindi/Telugu to English while maintaining lip synchronization. It processes videos by separating audio and video components, translating speech, and reconstructing with synchronized lip movements.

## Components

### 1. Video Processing
- **YouTube Download**: Using `pytube` for video acquisition
- **Media Separation**: 
  - `moviepy` for video manipulation
  - `pydub` for audio processing
  - `ffmpeg` for media format handling

### 2. Speech Processing
- **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI's Whisper model for Hindi/Telugu transcription
- **Text to Speech**: Microsoft's SpeechT5 TTS for English audio generation

### 3. Visual Synchronization
- **Lip Sync**: Implementation of Wav2Lip for matching lip movements with new audio

## Current Status
This is an experimental project that demonstrates:
- Successful component separation of YouTube videos
- Basic translation pipeline functionality
- Initial lip-sync implementation

## Limitations
- Processing time can be significant
- Quality varies based on input video quality
- Lip sync accuracy depends on multiple factors
- Currently supports limited language pairs

## Future Improvements
- Optimize processing pipeline
- Add support for more languages
- Improve lip-sync accuracy
- Enhance audio quality

## Acknowledgments
- OpenAI Whisper
- Microsoft SpeechT5
- Wav2Lip Project

## Note
This is an experimental project aimed at exploring the possibilities of automated video translation and lip synchronization.
